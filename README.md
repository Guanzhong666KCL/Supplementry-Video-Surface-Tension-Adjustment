Tests were conducted using silicone oil AR5 (5 cSt) in a 0.1 mM methylene blue aqueous solution. Volume concentrations of 0%, 0.08%, 0.10%, 0.12%, 0.15%, 0.18%, and 0.20% (v/v) were prepared. Droplets were actuated at speeds ranging from 1 to 4 frames per second to observe their fusion and fission behavior using video recordings.
